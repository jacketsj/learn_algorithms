The exercise is contained in the file `intro.cpp`.
You can compile it with
`g++ -std=c++11 intro.cpp -o intro`
and then run it with
`./intro`  
You can also do both at once with
`g++ -std=c++11 intro.cpp -o intro && ./intro`  
Try running it!
Then see if you can change it so it outputs the same text as running `intro_solution.cpp`.

Note that in general,
you can compile all your programs (within this project) the same way,
by replacing `intro` with the name of the program.
